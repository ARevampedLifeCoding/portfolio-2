      <p>
        I am new to being a software engineer. I have been coding for a few
        months now and loving every minute of it. However I will admit this is
        the hardest thing I have ever done. In the past I have been a welder
        with master level certifications. I then spent a while selling cars till
        I figured out what my next steps would be. I then pursued a career as a
        golf course superintendent. I earned a degree from pennsylvania state
        university in plant science. With the pandemic and the time away from my
        son, I decided to pursue other opportunities. Coding had been something
        that I had always been interested in and had looked to several different
        bootcamp options. I finally settled on the University of Denver!
        Choosing to start coding bootcamp has been the hardest yet most
        rewarding task I have ever taken on.
